-----------------FILE OVERVIEW-----------------
A stack is a FILO Datatype. Think of a physical
stack, when we put something onto the stack it
is on the top, and when we take something off
the stack, we take it off the top.

This file defines the basic functionalities
of a stack. These are push, pop, constructors
isEmpty, etc.

This stack uses a linked list to implement the
functions.
